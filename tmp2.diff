 We can, by just looking at the flyer, see some patterns and make some guesses.
-For example in last column the missing value is probably 50, similarly in 4
-column we can assume the missing value is 2d. Also we can notice that 2 and 6 column
+For example in last column the missing value is probably `50`, similarly in 4th
+column we can assume the missing value is `2d`. Also we can notice that 2nd and 6th column
 are connected in some way, for example if in row A 2nd value is equal to 6th in row B then
 2nd value of row B will be equal to 6th of row A.

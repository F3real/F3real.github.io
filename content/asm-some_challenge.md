On Munich BSides conference Google had this flyers with asm riddle.

~~~
It would be 'asm-some' to hear from you!
HINT: 32 bit
25 1c1f1c22 25 e3e0e3dd 2d 4e43422e 2d 37283c22 2d 1921411f 50
25 32322235 25 XXXXXXXX 2d 2c2f1b1b 2d 5c232129 2d 1380594c XX
25 2c2f1b1b 25 d3d0e4e4 XX 32322235 2d 22222422 2d 3d3c523c 50
25 XXXXXXXX 25 b1bcbdd1 2d 1c1f1c22 2d 25245424 2d 4c4c6252 50
~~~

We can, by just looking at the flyer, see some patterns and make some guesses.
For example in last column the missing value is probably `50`, similarly in 4th
column we can assume the missing value is `2d`. Also we can notice that 2nd and 6th column
are connected in some way, for example if in row A 2nd value is equal to 6th in row B then
2nd value of row B will be equal to 6th of row A.
 
Already using these guesses we can fill almost all of the missing fields but to get 
last one we need to understand what the values mean.

Following the hint and trying to decompile given hex string as 32 asm we get:

For this I used [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), but any decompiler should be fine.
If we look at binary representation of values in `AND` instructions we see they always 
cancel each other giving 0 as result. Based on this we can confirm that our guess for
`0x4e43422e` was correct and that last missing value should be `0xcaddcdcd`.

Last thing remaining, is to figure out what does this asm snippet do.
We can emulate it in C:
~~~c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main() {
    // Write C code here
    uint32_t EAX = 0;  // doesn't matter
    EAX &= 0x221C1F1C; // 00100010000111000001111100011100
    EAX &= 0xDDE3E0E3; // 11011101111000111110000011100011
    EAX -= 0x2E42434E;
    EAX -= 0x223C2837;
    EAX -= 0x1F412119;
    printf("0x%x\n", EAX);
 
    EAX &= 0x35223232; // 00110101001000100011001000110010
    EAX &= 0xCADDCDCD; // 11001010110111011100110111001101
    EAX -= 0x1B1B2F2C;
    EAX -= 0x2921235C;
    EAX -= 0x59800013;
    printf("0x%x\n", EAX);

	EAX &= 0x1B1B2F2C;  // 00011011000110110010111100101100
    EAX &= 0xE4E4D0D3;  // 11100100111001001101000011010011
    EAX -= 0x35223232;
    EAX -= 0x22242222;
    EAX -= 0x3C523C3D;
    printf("0x%x\n", EAX);

	EAX &= 0x2E42434E;  // 00101110010000100100001101001110
    EAX &= 0xD1BDBCB1;  // 11010001101111011011110010110001
    EAX -= 0x221C1F1C;
    EAX -= 0x24542425;
    EAX -= 0x52624C4C;
    printf("0x%x\n", EAX); 
    
    return 0;
}

If we run this program, we get:
~~~
0x90407362
0x6f6a2d65
0x6c676f6f
0x672d7073
~~~
and, taking in consideration endianess, this gives us solution:
`0x73702d676f6f676c652d6a6f62734090 -> sp-google-jobs@¬ê`

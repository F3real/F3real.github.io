Summary: Making interesting images in Python

Recently, I've been playing with converting images to ascii art and creating fractal images in Python. Both projects are pretty simple, fun and definitely worth trying out if you didn't attempt them before.

If you want to refer to my implementation, in case you get stuck here are the links:

* Simple intensity based conversion (with a bit added contouring) [here](https://github.com/F3real/ctf_solutions/tree/master/2019/python_ascii).

* Julia fractal generator [here](https://github.com/F3real/ctf_solutions/tree/master/2019/julia_fractal).

Summary: Creating cheat for the Hollow Knight

Hollow Knight is a good Metroidvania game with a great look and atmosphere but it can get annoying due to difficulty. So how to reduce frustration? Well, cheats of course.

There are trainers for Hollow Knight like all other games but it is more fun making your own. So let's look at how to create basic cheat using cheat engine. 

I decided to go for two pretty easy cheats:

* gold - stops you from grinding
* health - reduces annoying travel from check-point to the current place (I am not good at jump puzzles).

For these cheats to work we need to find correct offsets. Since the procedure is the same for both I'll focus only on health since it is a bit harder (the bigger the value you are looking it is easier to find for example 3450 is gonna be much more unique than 6).
